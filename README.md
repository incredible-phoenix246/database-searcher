# File Search Script

This Python script allows you to search for files in a directory and its subdirectories based on a specified file pattern.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git

   ```

2. **Navigate to the Script Directory**

   Use the cd command to move into the directory where the script is located:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   Run the Script
   ```

3. **Run the script by executing the following command**

   ```bash
   python file_search.py
   ```

4. **Enter Directory and File Pattern**

   The script will prompt you to enter the directory path and the file pattern (filename) you want to search for. For example:

   ```bash
   Enter the directory path to search in: /path/to/your/directory
   Enter the file pattern (e.g., '_.txt'): _.txt
   ```

   **Directory Path: Enter the full path to the directory where you want to start the search. You can use both relative and absolute paths.**

   **File Pattern: Specify the file pattern (e.g., .txt for all text files). The script will search for files that match this pattern.**

5. **View Search Results**

   The script will display a list of file paths that match the specified file pattern within the chosen directory and its subdirectories.

6. **Exit the Script**

   To exit the script, press Ctrl+C or follow the on-screen instructions.

   **Example**

   Here's an example of how to use the script:

   ```bash
   Enter the directory path to search in: /path/to/your/directory
   Enter the file pattern (e.g., '_.txt'): _.txt
   ```

   **Found matching files:**

   ````bash
   /path/to/your/directory/file1.txt
   /path/to/your/directory/subdirectory/file2.txt
   /path/to/your/directory/another_subdir/file3.txt```
   ````
